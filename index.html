            <p>This is a collection of everything I've worked on since I started coding, around May 2021.</p>
            <p>Almost everything is done in Javascript, with either the p5.js graphics library or WebGPU. The Onix
                Client Scripts are done in Lua, see "What is Onix Client" for more.</p>
            <p>You can find these projects <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/will-drac">on my GitHub.</a></p>
            <p>I have rated each project out of 5, rather ambiguously, just so that you can find the more impressive
                ones quicker.</p>
            <p>If you want to contact me, you can do so through my email, willdrac@yahoo.com, or on Discord
                @o2flash20.</p>
            <br>
            <p><u>If you want to see more from me, I have a separate website holding physics simulations that I have created with the help of a few friends, intended as a learning tool for students. You can find that <a href="https://o2flash20.github.io/physics-simulations/">here</a>!</u></p>
