    <h1>Blender Camera Exporter</h1>
    <p>As I was learning <a href="https://www.blender.org">Blender</a>, I had a thought that it would be cool if I could
        import my player's path into blender so that I can line up things rendered out of blender with the actual
        gameplay.</p>
    <video controls src="../images/blenderCam1.mov"></video>
    <p>Here, a fluid simulation is being ran in Blender, but since the virtual camera in Blender follows the exact same
        path that the player does in the recording of Minecraft, I can make it look like the fluid simulation was
        happening within the game.</p>
    <video controls src="../images/blenderCam2.mov"></video>
    <p>In this video, I exported both the player's path (using the script) and the Minecraft world (using a vanilla
        feature) into Blender. I could then use Blender's raytracer to make this video. None of this is a recording from
        the game except the movement.</p>
