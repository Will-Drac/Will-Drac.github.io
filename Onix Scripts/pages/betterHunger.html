    <h1>Better Hunger</h1>
    <p>A mod that gives you some more information about your player's hunger.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dark red is the level of hunger at which you can't sprint any more</li>
        <li>Red is regular hunger</li>
        <li>Green is the amount of hunger you'll have after you eat the thing you're holding.</li>
        <li>Yellow is the amount of saturation (kind of like a hidden hunger bar) you have.</li>
        <li>Lime is the amount of saturation you'll have after you eat what you're holding.</li>
        <li>In the middle of the bar, black means you can eat, red means you can't.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Apparently Minecraft changed how these values work, so the mod is broken currently.</p>
