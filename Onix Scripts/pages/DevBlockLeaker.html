    <h1>Dev Block Leaker</h1>
    <p>A mod that shows blocks that are usually invisible.</p>
    <p>This was originally made by another scripter, jqms/rosie, but I made it so that two of the three blocks it deals
        with are instead just one image which always faces the player (like how the game does it).</p>
    <p>I also did a cool little optimization, where they only render if they are on the screen</p>

    <p>These blocks should be invisible.</p>
