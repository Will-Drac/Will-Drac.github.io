    <h1>Logger</h1>
    <p>I didn't like scripting's method of debugging, which consisted of putting things in Minecraft chat, so I made my
        own thing.</p>
    <p>It also supports tables, which the old way doesn't, which is cool.</p>
    <p>This library also comes with a UI module, which you can see <a
            href="https://github.com/will-drac/My-Onix-Client-Scripts-Folder/blob/main/Modules/loggerUI.lua">here</a>
        (If not already, you may need to open this page in it's own tab using the "Open in new tab" button to click on
        that link)
    </p>
