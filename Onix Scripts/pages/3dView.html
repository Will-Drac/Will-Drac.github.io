    <h1>3d View</h1>
    <p>Renders a spinning 3d model of the world around the player.</p>
    <p>For whatever reason, I decided to do the 3d rendering myself instead of all the 3d stuff provided for me</p>
    <p>The 3d rendering method I used is some form of the Painter's Algorithm that I made up, before I even knew what it
        was called. Essentially, all of the 3d
        faces are rotated (instead of the camera) and then projected down to 2d. Then, the 2d shapes are drawn starting
        with the face that was furthest in 3d.</p>
