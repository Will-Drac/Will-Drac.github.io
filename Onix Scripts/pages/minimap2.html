    <h1>Minimap v2</h1>
    <p>I just tried this out again before writing this, and wow I forgot how cool this was.</p>
    <p>This was my first scripting mod, from March 15, 2022 (Minimap v1 wasn't made by me).</p>
    <p>It works by scanning a radius around the player, getting a simple colour for each block then:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>if that block is lower than the block directly under the player, darken it for how low it is. This gives a
            bit
            of depth perception. (in the image below, you can see that there's a slope down to the lake on the bottom
            right)
        </li>
        <li>if "Light Display" is toggled, darken or lighten the colour based on the light values at that block. (in
            the
            image below, you can see 4 torches placed around me)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This project was simultaneously super optimized, not optimized as much as it could be, and not optimized enough.
        In other words, FPS bad.</p>
