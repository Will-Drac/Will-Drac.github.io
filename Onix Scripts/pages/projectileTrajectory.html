    <h1>Projectile Trajectory</h1>
    <p>This mod is an improvement of <a href="./arrowTrail.html">Arrow Trajectory</a>. It automatically turns on or off
        depending on if you're holding a projectile, changes the trajectory depending on which projectile you're using,
        shows the trajectory as a line ending in a target, and uses the proper projectile motion equations:</p>

    <p>
        z: The displacement in the vertical direction. In Minecraft, this is actually the y-direction. (m)<br><br>
        x: The displacement in the x-direction (this is then rotated into Minecraft's z-direction depending on the
        player's yaw). (m)<br><br>
        v0: Magnitude of the initial velocity of the projectile. (m/s)<br><br>
        vt: Magnitude of the terminal (different from final) velocity of the projectile, representing the strength of
        air resistance. (m/s)<br><br>
        θ: The player's pitch. <br><br>
        g: The acceleration due to gravity. (m/s²)<br><br>
        t: The current time (s).<br><br>
    </p>
    <p>The values for these equations were determined partly by trial and error, and partly experimentally, by
        recording a projectile's position vs. time data in a file and graphing the motion. <a
            href="../images/projectileTrajectory3.zip">In case you're curious, you can download those graphs by clicking
            here.</a>
    </p>
    <h3>Here are the values determined for each projectile:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Snowballs and eggs: v0 = 30 m/s, g = 11.5 m/s², vt = 54.5 m/s</li>
        <li>Ender Pearls: v0 = 45 m/s, g = 22 m/s², NO AIR RESISTANCE</li>
        <li>Arrows: v0 = 83.6 m/s. g = 11.5 m/s², vt = 54.5 m/s</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, arrows have a small amount of unpredictable randomness.</p>
