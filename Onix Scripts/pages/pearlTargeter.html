    <h1>Ender Pearl Targeter</h1>

    <p>
        After figuring out the physics to predict an ender pearl's path, I figured it wouldn't be too hard to do the
        same thing but in reverse: finding the direction you would need to throw the pearl in to get it to land where
        you want.
    </p>
    <p>
        Interestingly, is mainly a physics problem, not a programming problem. We could derive formulas to solve for
        the direction that the player would have to throw the ender peal in.
    </p>
    <p>
        From <a href="./projectileTrajectory.html">Projectile Trajectory</a>, We know:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The initial speed of the ender peal after throwing it: \( v_i = 45m/s\)</li>
        <li>
            And the acceleration felt by the ender pearl when in flight. No air resistance, but the downward
            acceleration due to gravity \( a_y = -22.26m/s^2\)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There's a very handy equation in physics to tell you the final position of a projectile \(x_f\) given the
        initial position \(x_i\), the initial velocity \(v_{ix}\), the acceleration it feels \(a_x\), and the time it
        has been flying \(t\).
        $$ {x_f=x_i+v_{ix}t+\frac{1}{2}a_x t^2} $$
        This equation is only in the x-direction, but this works for y and z too, of course:
        $$ {y_f=y_i+v_{iy}t+\frac{1}{2}a_y t^2} $$
        $$ {z_f=z_i+v_{iz}t+\frac{1}{2}a_z t^2} $$
    </p>

    <p>
        The way the game works is that the ender pearl is always thrown at \(45m/s\), but the initial direction of the
        velocity is the same as the direction that the player is facing. So to find the direction that the player needs
        to face, we just have to find the initial velocity of the ender pearl, including the direction. This is why it's
        so helpful to have three equations. If we have the initial velocity in the x, y, and z directions, putting them
        together gives a 3D vector which has the direction we want.
    </p>

    <p>
        When the script tries to solve these equations, some of these variables will be known and some will be unknown.
        The initial and final positions will be known, since the initial position is just the player's position and the
        final position is the target. The accelerations are also known. Since there's no air resistance or anything else
        to interact with the projectile, \(a_x\) and \(a_z\) will be \(0m/s^2\) and \(a_y\) will be the acceleration due
        to gravity, \(-22.26m/s^2\). So that leaves the initial velocity in all 3 directions and the time it spends in
        the air unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
        There's a useful bit of wisdom that if you have X unknowns, you need X equations to be able to
        solve them all. We currently have 4 unknowns but only 3 equations. However, there's still a bit of information I
        have that isn't being used: We know \(v_i\). It's the magnitude of the vector made by \(v_{ix}\), \(v_{iy}\),
        and \(v_{iz}\), which means we can write my fourth equation:

        $$ {v_i^2=v_{ix}^2+v_{iy}^2+v_{iz}^2} $$
    </p>
    <p>
        Now all of my unknown can be found. I'm going to start by cleaning up my equations a bit. we can use the
        notation
        \(\Delta n = n_f-n_i\) to make them a bit shorter.
        $$ {\Delta x=v_{ix}t+\frac{1}{2}a_x t^2} $$
        $$ {\Delta y=v_{iy}t+\frac{1}{2}a_y t^2} $$
        $$ {\Delta z=v_{iz}t+\frac{1}{2}a_z t^2} $$
        And as I've said, \(a_x\) and \(a_z\) are known to be \(0m/s^2\), so we can remove the terms with them.
        $$ {\Delta x=v_{ix}t} $$
        $$ {\Delta y=v_{iy}t+\frac{1}{2}a_y t^2} $$
        $$ {\Delta z=v_{iz}t} $$
        Now you can take many different approaches here, but here's what I've chosen to do.
        $$ {\Delta x=v_{ix}t \Rightarrow t=\frac{\Delta x}{v_{ix}}} $$
        $$ {\Delta z=v_{iz}t \Rightarrow t=\frac{\Delta z}{v_{iz}}} $$
        $$ {t=\frac{\Delta x}{v_{ix}} = \frac{\Delta z}{v_{iz}} \Rightarrow v_{iz}=\frac{\Delta z}{\Delta x} v_{ix}} $$

        $$ {
        \Delta y=v_{iy}t+\frac{1}{2}a_y t^2
        \Rightarrow
        \Delta y=v_{iy}\frac{\Delta x}{v_{ix}}+\frac{1}{2}a_y \frac{\Delta x^2}{v_{ix}^2}
        } $$

        $$ {v_{iy}\frac{\Delta x}{v_{ix}} = \Delta y - \frac{1}{2}a_y \frac{\Delta x^2}{v_{ix}^2} } $$
        $$ {
        v_{iy} = \Delta y \frac{v_{ix}}{\Delta x} - \frac{1}{2}a_y \frac{\Delta x^2}{v_{ix}^2}\frac{v_{ix}}{\Delta x}
        } $$
        $$ {v_{iy} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} v_{ix} - \frac{1}{2}a_y \frac{\Delta x}{v_{ix}}} $$

        Now we have two unknowns in this equation. I want to get rid of \(v_{iy}\) so that I can solve for \(v_{ix}\).
        This is going to require a quick side-track.

        $$ {
        v_i^2=v_{ix}^2+v_{iy}^2+v_{iz}^2
        \Rightarrow
        v_{iy}^2=v_i^2-v_{ix}^2-v_{iz}^2
        } $$

        $$ {
        v_{iz}=\frac{\Delta z}{\Delta x} v_{ix}
        \Rightarrow
        v_{iy}^2=v_i^2-v_{ix}^2-(\frac{\Delta z}{\Delta x} v_{ix})^2
        } $$

        $$ {
        v_{iy}^2=v_i^2-v_{ix}^2-\frac{\Delta z^2}{\Delta x^2} v_{ix}^2
        } $$

        $$ {
        v_{iy}^2 = v_i^2 - (1+\frac{\Delta z^2}{\Delta x^2})v_{ix}^2
        } $$

        Now we can square both sides of the equation we left and substitute \(v_{iy}^2\) for what we just found, which
        only
        has \(v_{ix}\) as an unknown.

        $$ {v_{iy}^2 = (\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} v_{ix} - \frac{1}{2}a_y \frac{\Delta x}{v_{ix}})^2} $$

        $$ {
        v_i^2 - (1+\frac{\Delta z^2}{\Delta x^2})v_{ix}^2
        =
        \frac{\Delta y^2}{\Delta x^2}v_{ix}^2-a_y\Delta y+\frac{1}{4}a_y^2\frac{\Delta x^2}{v_{ix}^2}
        } $$

        And finally we have an equation with only one unknown. All that's left to do is grind out the algebra to solve
        for it. I'll start by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(v_{ix}^2\) to get rid of it in the denominator
        of that last term.

        $$ {
        v_i^2 v_{ix}^2 - (1+\frac{\Delta z^2}{\Delta x^2})v_{ix}^4
        =
        \frac{\Delta y^2}{\Delta x^2}v_{ix}^4-a_y v_{ix}^2 \Delta y+\frac{1}{4}a_y^2 \Delta x^2
        } $$

        $$ {
        0=
        (\frac{\Delta y^2}{\Delta x^2}+1+\frac{\Delta z^2}{\Delta x^2})v_{ix}^4
        +(-a_y\Delta y-v_i^2)v_{ix}^2
        +\frac{1}{4}a_y^2\Delta x^2
        } $$

        $$ {
        0=
        \frac{\Delta x^2+\Delta y^2+\Delta z^2}{\Delta x^2}v_{ix}^4
        +(-a_y\Delta y-v_i^2)v_{ix}^2
        +\frac{1}{4}a_y^2\Delta x^2
        } $$

        I'll make two quick simplifications here.
        I'll let \(X = v_{ix}^2\)
        and \(\Delta d^2=\Delta x^2+\Delta y^2+\Delta z^2\)

        $$ {
        0=
        \frac{\Delta d^2}{\Delta x^2}X^2
        +(-a_y\Delta y-v_i^2)X
        +\frac{1}{4}a_y^2\Delta x^2
        } $$

        We can now use the quadratic equation to solve for \(X\).

        $$ {
        X=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
        } $$

        Where \(a=\frac{\Delta d^2}{\Delta x^2}\),
        \(b=-a_y\Delta y-v_i^2\), and
        \(c=\frac{1}{4}a_y^2\Delta x^2\)

        $$ {
        X
        = \frac
        {
        a_y\Delta y+v_i^2\pm
        \sqrt{(-a_y\Delta y-v_i^2)^2-4(\frac{\Delta d^2}{\Delta x^2})(\frac{1}{4}a_y^2\Delta x^2)}
        }
        {2\frac{\Delta d^2}{\Delta x^2}}
        } $$

        Substituting \(v_{ix}^2\) back in and simplifying:
        $$ {
        v_{ix}^2
        = \frac
        {
        a_y\Delta y+v_i^2\pm
        \sqrt{(-a_y\Delta y-v_i^2)^2-\Delta d^2a_y^2}
        }
        {2\frac{\Delta d^2}{\Delta x^2}}
        } $$

        And finally, both sides can be square rooted and \(v_{ix}\) is solved.
        $$ {
        v_{ix}
        = \pm \sqrt{
        \frac
        {
        a_y\Delta y+v_i^2\pm
        \sqrt{(-a_y\Delta y-v_i^2)^2-\Delta d^2a_y^2}
        }
        {2\frac{\Delta d^2}{\Delta x^2}}
        }
        } $$

        $$ {
        v_{ix}
        = \pm
        \frac
        {\sqrt{
        a_y\Delta y+v_i^2\pm
        \sqrt{(-a_y\Delta y-v_i^2)^2-\Delta d^2a_y^2}
        }}
        {\sqrt{2}\frac{\Delta d}{\Delta x}}
        } $$

        It's admittedly an ugly-looking equation, so I'm going to keep the \(\Delta d\)s in there to not make it worse.
        Thankfully, \(v_{iy}\) and \(v_{iz}\) can be expressed way more simply now that \(v_{ix}\) is a known value. In
        fact, the equations have already been found:

        $$ {v_{iy} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} v_{ix} - \frac{1}{2}a_y \frac{\Delta x}{v_{ix}}} $$
        $$ {v_{iz}=\frac{\Delta z}{\Delta x} v_{ix}} $$

        And the time it will spend in the air can also be known:
        $${
        t=\frac{\Delta x}{v_{ix}}
        } $$

        A way to these values to the player in a way they'll understand is dividing them all by some value, then adding
        them to the player's position and rendering them as a point in the world. Then all the player has to do is aim
        their crosshair at that point and they'll give the ender pearl the correct velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
        There's still a bit of an issue though. Those two \(\pm\) symbols mean that there are not one but four possible
        \(v_{ix}\) values, and thus four ways for the player to throw the ender pearl to get it to hit the target. Well,
        not really. Two of those solutions are genuine: think of throwing a ball at a target in real life. You can throw
        the ball directly at it or throw it up in the air so that it falls down to it. The other two solutions come from
        the math not knowing that time only runs forward, and can be discarded. Yeah, seriously.
