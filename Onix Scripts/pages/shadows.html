    <h1>Shadows</h1>
    <p>One day I had the stupid idea to add shadows to Minecraft through scripting. Stupid, especially because you can't
        write shaders in scripting.</p>
    <p>But one thing you can do in scripting is draw three-dimensional textured quadrilaterals into the game. So I made
        do with what I had. The idea was to render quads into the world, layered on top of the existing terrain, that
        creates the illusion of things being blocked from the sun.</p>
    <p>I've drawn a diagram to illustrate my solution:</p>
    <img src="../images/shadows1.png">

    <p>The shadow tiles texture.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Every part of this project was hard, and each one of the text boxes you see above came with a great deal of
        head-scratching. Dealing with such a huge amount of data was a difficult task, and figuring out how to make it
        possible to be real-time at all was quite the puzzle. But, I'm proud of it, and I think it turned out well.</p>

    <p>Performance mode runs at almost the same speed as without the mod enabled.<br> Balanced drops it from 120fps to
        85fps. High drops it from 120fps to 40fps. <br>Cinematic drops it from 120fps to 20fps with noticeable frame
        drops.
