    <h1>Lag Switch</h1>
    <p>When you press a button, it freezes your game. But not only your game, it also freezes you for other people,
        making it seem like you're flying or hacking.</p>
    <p>I would show a picture or video of it, but I don't think it would be very helpful seeing as it would just be the
        game frozen.</p>
