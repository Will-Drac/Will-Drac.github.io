    <h1>Daylight Cycle Speed Changer</h1>
    <p>Changes the speed of the day/night cycle on the client-side, meaning only the user can see it.</p>
    <p>It does this by continuously changing the value of a setting in a default client mod, Environment Changer, which
        lets the user set their client-side time. Environment Changer needs to be enabled for it to work.</p>
