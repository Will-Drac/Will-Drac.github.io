    <h1>Replay Mod</h1>
    <p>I had a few ideas to make replay mod entirely using scripting, and I got a lot of it done, but I knew that it
        wouldn't be good enough to be worth the effort, so I gave up.</p>
    <p>Another scripter, Tom16/jerry, contributed a bit to this. He had a way better idea for how to make replay mod,
        though, and the skills to actually go through with it. So he's been slowly working on this own replay mod.</p>

    <p>Recording a replay.</p>

    <p>Replaying... a replay. First a section of the world that the replay was recorded it in loaded, then the player is
        teleported around to simulate their movement in the recording. Block changes are also recorded and replayed at
        the correct time.</p>
