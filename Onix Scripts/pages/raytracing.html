    <h1>Raytracing</h1>
    <p>In all the images and videos you've seen so far, I've been using Minecraft's official ray tracing feature, which
        is already really cool.</p>
    <p>But why not make my own?</p>
    <p>OK, two very good reasons. 1: I can't use the GPU with scripting, which means that it's going to be
        excruciatingly slow. 2: It's RAY TRACING.</p>
    <p>So anyways, I did it. Here are the results. As a disclaimer, some of the images you will see were rendered at
        multiple
        minutes (in some cases up to over an hour) per frame, even though the effects are drawn over the regular game.
