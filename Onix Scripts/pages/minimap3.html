    <h1>Minimap v3</h1>
    <p>This is the second version of my minimap script (Minimap v1 wasn't made by me). It's lacking in features compared
        to the original, but
        performance is way better and there are more blocks that it knows how to handle in terms of giving the right
        colour.</p>

    <img src="../images/miniMap1.png">
    <p>This version stores blocks that were previously scanned, and renders the map a bit more efficiently, allowing for
        larger maps at better frame rates.</p>
