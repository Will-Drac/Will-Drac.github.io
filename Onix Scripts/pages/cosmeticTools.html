    <h1>Cosmetic Tools</h1>
    <p>Now this one was fun.</p>
    <p>This is a library to let people easily make their own 3d cosmetics. It turned out to be a pretty decent 3d
        rendering tool, with cubes, spheres, shading, textures, and rotations.</p>
    <p>I would show people's uses of it, but apparently no one wanted to read through twenty minutes worth of
        documentation...</p>

    <br>
    <p>Here are some pictures of spheres generated using this lib. It uses the technique of subdividing a cube and then
        making all of it's vertices the same distance away from the center, deforming it into a sphere.</p>

    <p>Textures, animation, and cape physics, all done using the library.</p>
