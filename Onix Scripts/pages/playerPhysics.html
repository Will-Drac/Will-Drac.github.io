    <h1>Player Physics Library</h1>

    <p>I made this library to be able to quickly get the player's velocity and acceleration vectors. I mention vectors
        because it uses and even comes with my <a href="vectors.html">vectors library</a>.</p>
    <p>To get the player's velocity, the position vectors of the last few intervals are saved, then split into two
        halves. For each half, the average position and time of its points are calculated. Then using the averages of
        the two halves, velocity is calculated using the equation:
        $$ {\vec{v} = \frac{\Delta\vec{s}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\vec{s}_{avg2}-\vec{s}_{avg1}}{t_{avg2}-t_{avg1}} } $$
        where \(\vec{s}\) is the position vector of the player.</p>
    <p>The averages are done reduce the effect of the small amount of randomness in the player's position. Ideally,
        \(\Delta\vec{s} = \vec{s}_2-\vec{s}_1\) would be able to be calculated simply from one frame to the next.</p>
    <p>The drawback is that the velocity calculated lags behind reality a bit, and the more positions used in the
        average, the smoother the output is, but the more it lags behind.</p>
    <p>The player's acceleration is calculated the same way, but with velocity points being stored and averaged instead
        of position:
        $$ {\vec{a} = \frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\vec{v}_{avg2}-\vec{v}_{avg1}}{t_{avg2}-t_{avg1}} } $$</p>
    <p>
        The velocity calculated at a certain time is said to be the velocity at that time, even though it's
        known to be a bit behind as discussed above.</p>
