    <h1>Camera Effects</h1>
    <p>Adds two effects to the game that you would get from a real camera: auto exposure and lens flares.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Auto exposure brightens the screen when you look at something dark, allowing you to see it better. It's a more
        realistic and immersive version of fullbright.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Lens flares appear as blurry and coloured images of the sun, and exist in 2d as transformations of the real sun.
        In reality, lens flares are due to some unintended behaviour of light within a camera's lens.</p>
