    <h1>Free Cam</h1>
    <p>Uses textured quads to render the game a second time in front of the first, but this time from another point of
        view which can be freely moved around everywhere and anywhere.</p>
    <p>It exists now with a bug in rendering (at least it's kinda fast) and no textures, I should really fix it...</p>

    <p>Using the mod to explore a cave without actually going in.</p>
