    <h1>Vectors Library</h1>
    <p>At the time of making the script (and at the time of writing this) scripting doesn't have any kind of vector
        support. So I went and did it myself, copying and recreating all of the vector function and features from p5.js
        (what I use to make all the javascript projects you see on this website). I also thought it would be cool to
        make all types of vectors just "vec" instead of "vec2", "vec3", etc. So you decide how many dimensions a vector
        will have when you create it, and everything else will be done seamlessly.</p>
    <p>Documentation for the library is at the end of the script file, like usual.</p>
